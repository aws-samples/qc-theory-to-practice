    "Lets start with how you can search a value in an unsorted list of numbers using classical computers. Let’s take a list of 10 numbers in no particular order, such as, `[3,6,1,9,7,2,5,0,8,4]`. Lets say, you want to search for 8 in this list. Since the list is in no particular order, you will have to check the list items one-by-one till you find a match. If you went from left to right, it would take you 9 tries in this list of 10 numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking for the match can be seen as a call to an oracle function, which returns True if the input is the number we are looking for, else returns False. So, the oracle function would be called 9 times before you find 8 in the list. However, if you were searching for 3, then you would be lucky and find it on the first try.\n",
    "\n",
    "On average, you will need to check a list of $N$ numbers $N/2$ times. In other words, it has time complexity of $O(N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is exciting though is that on a quantum computer you can perform this search in time-complexity of $O(\\sqrt{N})$ using Grover’s algorithm. "
