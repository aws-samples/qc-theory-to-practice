## Take Quantum Computing from Theory to Practice with Amazon Braket Service


This is the code accompanying the blog post **Take Quantum Computing from Theory to Practice with Amazon Braket Service**. In that post, we explore quantum computing using [Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/). The blog takes an educational approach for this by using a well-known quantum algorithm, Grover’s algorithm. It first explains how Grover’s algorithm works, then introduces a problem which involves identifying a set of friends that can be invited together to a party satisfying a set of constraints. And then explains how Grover’s algorithm can be used to solve it.

[Grover’s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm) is a widely cited and historically important quantum algorithm. It was a significant early milestone that helped demonstrate the potential power of quantum computers. It’s arguably almost as well-known as Shor’s factoring algorithm. It’s primarily used for searching in unstructured search spaces and provides a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms for this category of problems. Theoretically it can be applied to areas like cryptanalysis, optimization problems, machine learning, or quantum simulation. While the practical use of Grover's algorithm is currently limited by the availability of large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers, it’s a great choice for learning and exploring ideas involved in quantum computing.
